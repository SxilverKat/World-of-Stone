# World of Stone

A massive geological overhaul for Minecraft. 1800+ blocks across 24 stone strata in three types with full building sets, hundreds of speleothems, and highly customizable worldgen. This is a modern revamp of the Underground Biomes mod by ExterminatorJeff, CurtisA, and LouisDB.

## Strata System

The underground generates in layered geological strata which are inspired by real rock types:

- **Igneous:** Adamellite, Pyroxenite, Rhyolite, Tonalite, Gabbro, Latite, Komatiite, Dacite.
- **Metamorphic:** Gneiss, Eclogite, Marble, Quartzite, Blueschist, Greenschist, Soapstone, Migmatite.
- **Sedimentary:** Limestone, Chalk, Shale, Siltstone, Lignite, Dolomite, Greywacke, Chert.

Each variant has a full building palette (all stairs, slabs, and walls included):

- Strata Variant Cobblestone, Mossy Cobblestone, Bricks, Mossy Bricks, Cracked Bricks, Chiseled Bricks.
- Overgrown & Snowed Surface Variants.
- Strata Variant Sand, Sandstone, Cut Sandstone, Chiseled Sandstone, and Smooth Sandstone.
- Polished Strata Variants, Polished Stairs, Polished Slabs, Polished Walls.
- Strata Variant Tiles, Cracked Tiles, Tile Stairs, Tile Slabs, Tile Walls.
- Strata Variant Pillars, Smooth Strata, Smooth Strata Slabs, Gravel, Clay, Buttons, and Speleothems.
- Infested Strata, Cobblestone, Bricks, Mossy Bricks, Cracked Bricks, and Chiseled Bricks.

## Speleothems (260+)

Stalactite/stalagmite blocks for caves and nearly every block in the game:

- Vanilla strata speleothems (Stone, Granite, Deepslate, Calcite, Dripstone, Netherrack, Basalt, Blackstone, End Stone, Sandstone, Smooth Basalt).
- Terracotta speleothems (all 16 colors).
- Strata speleothems for all 24 variants and their sandstone forms.
- Decorative speleothems (130+): every wood type, wool, concrete, glazed terracotta, ore blocks, raw resource blocks, stained glass, coral, mushroom blocks, mud, soul sand/soil, ice, slime, honey, sculk, hay, bedrock, leaves, and more.
- Mimic speleothems: a block entity that takes the texture of any block you add to the config list (`mimicBlocks`) through NBT data.

## Ore Variants

- 24 strata variants along with the 4 vanilla overworld variants (Granite, Diorite, Andesite, Tuff) for all 8 types of ore — 224 overworld ore variants total.
- Nether ore variants for Netherrack, Blackstone, and Basalt.
- End ore variants for End Stone.
- Obsidian ore variants for ores embedded in obsidian.

## Worldgen Systems

- **NOISE** (default, recommended): 3D noise-driven layered strata.
- **BLOB:** vanilla-style ore-vein blobs.
- **CHUNK:** patch regions — each chunk gets a single dominant variant, the original system used by Underground Biomes.

Surface stones automatically pick snowed or overgrown variants based on biome temperature and sky exposure. Snow that accumulates on exposed strata also converts them to snowed variants over time.

## Mason Villager Trades

- **LV 2:** buys chiseled bricks for emeralds.
- **LV 3:** buys raw stone/cobble; sells bricks, sandstone, mossy bricks, and smooth/chiseled sandstone.
- **LV 5:** sells pillar variants.

## Configuration

Basically everything is configurable.

- Toggles for stone replacement, speleothems, infested blocks, and mason trades.
- Every variant can be enabled/disabled along with their worldgen weight.
- All speleothems can be enabled/disabled for all variants.
- Worldgen system selection: scale, octaves, and noise type.
- Strata height ratios (igneous/metamorphic/sedimentary).
- Allow strata in deepslate layers.
- Allow vanilla ores in Nether/End.
- Allow obsidian ore variants.
- Allow overgrown/snowed for strata and vanilla stone variants.
- Strata drops cobblestone toggle.
- Lignite drops cobblestone instead of lignite coal toggle.
- Pillar variant trades toggle.
- Speleothem behavior (waterlogging, breaking, sky view, fall damage, drip damage, drop on fall).
- Fossil drop chance and custom drop block list.
- Mimic speleothem block list.
